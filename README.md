```

2. Open `walkie_talkie.ino` in Arduino IDE

3. Select your board:
   - Tools ‚Üí Board ‚Üí ESP32 Arduino ‚Üí ESP32C3 Dev Module

4. Configure the first device as **MASTER**:

```cpp
#define ROLE_MASTER 0  // Station
```

7. Upload to second ESP32-C3

### First Run

1. Power on the **MASTER** device first
   - LED will blink 3 times indicating ready
   - Creates WiFi network "ESP32_C3_Master"

2. Power on the **SLAVE** device
   - LED blinks while connecting
   - 3 blinks when connected successfully

3. Start talking! The LED will:
   - Stay **ON** when you're transmitting
   - **Quick blink** when receiving audio

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Audio Settings

```cpp
// Adjust these for your environment
#define AUDIO_THRESHOLD 500   // Voice detection sensitivity (lower = more sensitive)
#define HANG_TIME_MS 300      // Gate hang time in ms (prevents choppy audio)
#define MIC_GAIN 3.0f         // Microphone amplification (1.0 - 5.0)
#define SPEAKER_GAIN 2.5f     // Speaker volume (1.0 - 5.0)
```

### Network Settings

```cpp
const char* ssid = "ESP32_C3_Master";     // WiFi network name
const char* password = "12345678";         // WiFi password (min 8 chars)
#define SAMPLE_RATE 16000                  // Audio sample rate (Hz)
```

### I2S Configuration

```cpp
#define I2S_BCLK 7        // Bit clock pin
#define I2S_LRCK 6        // Left/Right clock pin
#define I2S_DIN 3         // Data in (microphone)
#define I2S_DOUT 5        // Data out (speaker)
#define PACKET_SAMPLES 64 // Samples per packet (affects latency)
```

## üîß Tuning Guide

### If Audio is Too Quiet
```cpp
#define MIC_GAIN 4.0f      // Increase microphone gain
#define SPEAKER_GAIN 3.5f  // Increase speaker volume
```

### If You Experience Feedback/Echo
- Increase physical distance between devices
- Reduce gains:
```cpp
#define MIC_GAIN 2.0f
#define SPEAKER_GAIN 2.0f
```

### If Voice Cuts In/Out
```cpp
#define AUDIO_THRESHOLD 300  // Lower threshold (more sensitive)
#define HANG_TIME_MS 500     // Longer hang time (less aggressive gating)
```

### If Audio Sounds Distorted
- Reduce gain values
- Check power supply (needs stable 5V/3.3V)
- Verify I2S connections

## üìä Technical Details

### Audio Pipeline

```

Gate + Gain ‚Üí UDP Packet ‚Üí WiFi ‚Üí UDP Receive ‚Üí 
Gain ‚Üí I2S DMA ‚Üí Speaker
```

### Performance Metrics

- **Latency**: ~4ms (packet size) + ~10-30ms (network)
- **Sample Rate**: 16 kHz (telephone quality)
- **Bit Depth**: 16-bit signed PCM
- **Packet Size**: 64 samples (128 bytes)
- **Network**: UDP/IP over WiFi 802.11n
- **Range**: ~10-30 meters (depends on environment)

### Voice Activity Detection

The system uses energy-based VAD with:
1. High-pass filtering to remove DC and low-freq noise
2. Threshold comparison on filtered audio
3. Gate with hang time for natural speech

### High-Pass Filter

First-order IIR filter:
- **Cutoff**: 300 Hz
- **Purpose**: Removes breath noise, handling noise, electrical hum
- **Type**: RC high-pass

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Master Device Won't Start AP
- Check if WiFi credentials are valid
- Ensure no other device is using the same SSID
- Reset ESP32-C3 and try again

### Slave Can't Connect
- Verify Master is powered on first
- Check WiFi password is correct (min 8 characters)
- Ensure devices are within range (~10m initially)

### No Audio Output
- Verify I2S pin connections
- Check speaker amplifier has power
- Test with higher `SPEAKER_GAIN` value
- Monitor Serial output for "Received" packets

### No Audio Input
- Check microphone VDD is 3.3V
- Verify microphone L/R pin is grounded
- Increase `MIC_GAIN` or lower `AUDIO_THRESHOLD`
- Speak louder or closer to microphone

### Choppy/Garbled Audio
- Check WiFi signal strength
- Reduce physical obstacles between devices
- Lower `PACKET_SAMPLES` for less latency (more overhead)
- Ensure stable power supply (use USB 2.0+ ports)

### High-Pitched Feedback
- Increase distance between devices
- Reduce `MIC_GAIN` and `SPEAKER_GAIN`
- Add physical separation (different rooms)
- Cover microphone when not speaking

## üìà Monitoring & Debugging

### Serial Monitor Output

```
=== MASTER MODE (AP) ===
AP IP: 192.168.4.1
Waiting for slave to connect...
I2S initialized
Walkie-Talkie ready!
----------------------
Sent: 1250 | Received: 1180
```

### Statistics
- View packet counts every 10 seconds
- `Sent`: Packets transmitted when speaking
- `Received`: Packets received from other device
- Difference indicates packet loss

## üî¨ Advanced Customization

### Changing Sample Rate

```cpp
#define SAMPLE_RATE 22050  // Better quality (more bandwidth)
// or
#define SAMPLE_RATE 8000   // Lower quality (less bandwidth)
```

### Adding AEC (Acoustic Echo Cancellation)

For advanced users, consider implementing:
- Adaptive filtering
- Speex DSP library
- Time-domain correlation

### Multi-Device Support

Modify UDP logic to support multiple receivers:
```cpp
// Broadcast to multiple slaves
IPAddress broadcast(192, 168, 4, 255);
udp.beginPacket(broadcast, PORT_SLAVE);
```
